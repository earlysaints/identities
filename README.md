![Early Saints logo](http://earlysaints.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/early_saints_v01a.png)

The aim of this group is to sponsor, develop, and maintain
a simple identification apparatus for individual early Latter-day
Saints. This includes issuing unique IDs to allow improved
mapping of records and other data related to persons affiliated
with early Mormonism. We also present schema standards for
improved interoperability between different projects and their
databases.
