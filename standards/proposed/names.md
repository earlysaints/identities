## 1. Introduction

Naming conventions across cultures and families change such that one field title
may break with an individual person's name. How should one structure a database
and make sense of the distinctions between Joseph Smith Sr., Joseph Smith Jr.,
"Joseph Smith," Joseph Fielding Smith Sr., "Joseph F. Smith," Joseph Fielding
Smith Jr., and "Joseph Fielding Smith"?

What is needed is a standard schema providing semantically consistent mappings
for personal naming customs and preferences to be expressed yet accessible to
data analysis. This recommended standard addresses naming concerns at the data
level to provide consistency across data stores using early Latter-day Saint
identities.
